## 🔮 What is EmpathAI?

**EmpathAI** is an open-source SDK that enables web applications to detect and respond to **user emotions** in real time using **non-intrusive behavior signals** — such as typing speed, mouse movement, and interaction patterns.

The `@empathai/core` package provides the core hook and engine for capturing and analyzing this behavior in **React apps**. Future modules (`@empathai/analytics`, `@empathai/chatbot`, `@empathai/enterprise`) will plug into this core.
